**Alien Invasion**
Welcome to Alien Invasion, a classic arcade-style shooter game built using Pygame!
Pilot your spaceship, dodge enemy fleets, and blast away aliens as they descend from above. The longer you survive, the faster and more intense the action becomes. Think you're up for the challenge?

**About the Game**
Alien Invasion is a fun and interactive space-themed game where you:
  1. Move your ship left and right to dodge enemies
  2. Fire bullets to eliminate waves of aliens
  3. Watch the difficulty ramp up with every new level
  4. Track your score, high score, level, and remaining lives on-screen

Whether you're a casual gamer or someone exploring game development, this project is a great blend of logic, interactivity, and creativity!

**How to Play**
   1. Run the Game: Simply execute python alien_invasion.py
   2. Move Left: Press the Left Arrow key
   3. Move Right: Press the Right Arrow key
